### Project Overview: BTK Akademi Datathon 2024

In this project, we focus on analyzing the **BTK Akademi Datathon 2024** dataset. The goal is to gain insights from the data, apply machine learning models, and ultimately build a robust predictive system. You can access the official Datathon page for more details on the dataset and competition rules.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

We conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we examined and visualized the distribution, relationships, and key characteristics of each feature in the dataset. These insights helped us to better understand the underlying structure of the data and guided our approach in selecting the most appropriate machine learning models.

### Machine Learning and Model Optimization

To tackle the predictive challenge, we implemented a wide range of machine learning regression models, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Regression**
- **XGBoost**
- And several others.

After evaluating the performance of individual models, we enhanced our solution by utilizing **Optuna**, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework. We used it to fine-tune our models and create a **weighted ensemble** of the best-performing algorithms, maximizing overall prediction accuracy.
